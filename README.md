# Alumni Connect

A social networking platform that connects Alumni with the students. Key features:
* Leveraged Action Cable and Redis to manage web socket connections for live messaging and real-time notifications.
* Improved query performance by following Active Record best practices, Database indexing, eliminating N+1 queries
and by adding counter caching.
* Created RESTful API for developers to access the content of the website using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
* Integrated Elasticsearch to improve search results and reduce query response times.
* Dockerized the entire application, orchestrated using Docker Swarm, and deployed it to Digital Ocean.
